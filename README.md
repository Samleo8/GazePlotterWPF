GazePlotterWPF
==============

A simple application that plots gaze data coming out of The Eye Tribe API.

Current functionality:
 - Left and right eye gaze X/Y coordinates (when calibrated)
 - Left and right eye pupil size
 - Flashed background to indicate a potential blink event 
   this is based on momentarily lost tracking, see source for the crude implementation.
